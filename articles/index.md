## How These Articles Connect

Each article contributes to one or more phases of the **Future Freedom** framework:

1. Decode the Fog  
2. Connect the Dots  
3. Plan the Future  
4. Empower Leaders  
5. Live the Infrastructure  

Together, they form a growing, interconnected knowledge base for families navigating disability systems with clarity and confidence.
