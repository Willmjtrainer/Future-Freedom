# **The Fog of Transition to Adulthood**



The IEP ends. The bus stops. And silence follows.



For families of young adults with disabilities, the transition to adulthood is less a milestone—and more a cliff.

You’ve been guided (or pushed) through a system since diagnosis. There were teachers, therapists, IEP meetings. Maybe even a bit of structure. But after high school? That system collapses—fast.



This is the Fog of Transition.
And if families don’t start early, this fog swallows futures.



###### **What No One Tells You**

You don’t get an “adult IEP.” You don’t get Medicaid automatically. You don’t get SSI without proof and persistence. You don’t get employment services without jumping through ten more hoops. And most terrifying of all, you don’t get told this until the safety net is already gone.



Parents ask: “*Where did the supports go?*” But the real question is: “*Who taught us how to build the next set of supports?*”

In most states, it takes YEARS to get on a Medicaid waiver. If you haven’t applied by 14 or 15, you might not have the coverage you need by 18.

SSI applications can get denied multiple times, especially if families don’t know how to document need under adult standards.

And employment? It’s not about job fairs or hope. It’s about intentional planning, skill-building, community partnerships, and understanding how benefits interact with work.



Most families aren’t told any of this. Not by the school. Not by the doctors. Not by the government agencies that will soon take over service provision.



That’s the Fog. And it’s not your fault.



###### **What Planning Looks Like Instead**

Planning is asking: What do we want *life* to look like at 25? Not just what services will we need, but what purpose, what community, what joy?

It’s building Present Levels and IEP goals that connect directly to that adult life vision. It’s requesting Vocational Rehabilitation support while still in school. It’s teaching your child (and yourself) how to speak up in adult systems where the language is colder, the waiting lists longer, and the burden of proof is on you.



It’s hard. But it’s possible. And it’s what we call **Disability System Confidence**™.



When you start early, you gain options. When you ask the right questions, you skip the panic. When you build a Family Strategy™, the fog clears.



###### **What I Want You to Know**

You are not behind. You are not broken. You are not alone.



But you are the architect. And architects don’t wait for the cliff to appear—they build the bridge before they get there.

So here’s the truth no one wants to say out loud: If you wait until the school bus stops showing up, your family could be SOL stuck in waitlists, scrambling for benefits, and watching freedom slip further out of reach.



**Future Freedom™ doesn’t wait for the last day of school.** It starts with you building the plan before the system drops out from under you.

Because when you lead, your child doesn’t fall off the cliff. They fly.
