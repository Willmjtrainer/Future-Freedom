# **The Fog of Benefits: What Families Lose When They Wait**



There’s a fog most families don’t see until it’s too late. It doesn’t swirl through schools or show up in a diagnosis. It creeps in quietly years later when the safety nets aren’t there. When the paperwork is wrong, the bank balance is too high, or the system says: “Your child doesn’t qualify.”



This is the fog of Social Security, Medicaid, and long-term disability supports and it’s one of the most dangerous forms of delay a family can make. Because in this system, waiting costs everything.



###### **The $2,000 Mistake**

You wouldn’t think a simple savings account could ruin your child’s future. But if it holds more than $2,000, it can. That’s the resource limit for Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). If your young adult has more than that in their name, whether it’s birthday money, inheritance, a checking account, or a well-meaning gift from Grandma, they can be denied benefits that pay for critical health care, therapies, housing, and long-term supports.

And no one tells families this in time.



###### **The Invisible Deadline Before Age 22**

Here’s what they really don’t tell you:

If your child’s disability diagnosis isn’t documented before age 22 by the Social Security Administration, their eligibility for major adult benefits, including Disabled Adult Child (DAC) benefits, can vanish. DAC benefits are tied to the parent's Social Security record and can mean lifetime income and medical access after the parent retires, becomes disabled, or passes away.

No school evaluation? No doctor’s diagnosis before 22?

That one missing document can cost your child decades of support.

And here’s the cruel irony: it’s far easier to get an evaluation or diagnosis while still in school than after. Once the school bus stops coming, so do the system's built-in supports.



###### **Yes! Your Child Can Work (and Keep Benefits)**

Many families are told: “If your child works, they’ll lose everything.” That’s wrong.



Thanks to **Work Incentives**, young adults with disabilities can work, earn money, build skills, and still keep their Medicaid and SSI. But you have to know how to do it.



And again, most families don’t. They hear rumors, get scared, and opt out of the workforce entirely cutting off one of the most important paths to independence.



###### **Medicaid: The Gatekeeper to Everything**

Why does all this matter so much?

Because Medicaid isn’t just health insurance. It’s the ticket to:

• Long-term care

• Attendant services

• Medicaid waiver programs

• Supported housing

• Behavioral therapies

• Transportation

• Day activity programs

• And more



No SSI? No Medicaid. No Medicaid? No waiver supports or long term care. No waiver supports? You’re alone. And the older your child gets, the more vital these become.



###### **The Risk of Doing Nothing**

Families don’t fail their children. But systems fail families who don’t know the rules.

Waiting to apply. Waiting to ask questions. Waiting for someone to tell you what to do.

That’s how futures fall apart. That’s how Social Security letters say “denied.” That’s how health care disappears. That’s how your child gets left out of programs designed to protect them.

And worst of all? It’s preventable.



###### **What Disability System Confidence™ Looks Like**

Disability System Confidence isn’t about knowing every detail. It’s about knowing where the traps are and having a map. It’s asking early, applying on time, documenting everything, and knowing that your child’s future depends not on what they can’t do, but on what you choose to do next.



This isn’t fear-based planning. This is **Freedom Planning** before it’s too late.



**If you remember nothing else, remember this:**

❗ Get a recent disability diagnosis documented **before 22**

❗ Apply for **SSI and Medicaid early**, even if your child isn’t “ready” yet

❗ Keep your child’s assets **below $2,000**, or talk to someone who can help you protect them

❗ Know that **Work Incentives** exist and they change everything

❗ And above all, **don’t wait for the last day of school** to start learning about adulthood



**You are not behind. But you don’t have time to waste.**



The future doesn’t get built in a panic. It gets built with **clarity, courage, and commitment.**

And that future still belongs to your child…if you claim it.



**Your child’s future isn’t defined by a diagnosis.**

**It’s shaped by what you do next.**
